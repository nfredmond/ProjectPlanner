# RTPA Project Prioritization Platform v0.2.0

A comprehensive web application for Regional Transportation Planning Agencies (RTPAs) to manage, analyze, and prioritize transportation projects. This platform integrates advanced tools like Large Language Models (LLMs) for intelligent assistance, robust GIS mapping for spatial analysis, and data-driven scoring methodologies aligned with California and federal guidelines.

## Getting Started (For Developers)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Supabase account
- OpenAI API key (or Anthropic API key)
- Mapbox access token (optional)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/rtpa-project-prioritization.git
   cd rtpa-project-prioritization
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
   - Fill in the required values:
     - Supabase URL and keys
     - OpenAI API key (o3-mini model recommended) or Anthropic API key (Claude 3.7 Sonnet recommended)
     - Mapbox access token (if using)

4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Database Setup

The application uses Supabase for database, authentication, and storage. The initial schema is defined in `supabase/migrations/00001_initial_schema.sql`.

To set up the database:

1. Create a new Supabase project
2. Run the migration script in the Supabase SQL editor
3. Enable the PostGIS extension for geospatial features
4. Configure Row-Level Security (RLS) policies as defined in the migration script
