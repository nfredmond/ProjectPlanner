## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended for non-technical users)

1. Sign up on Vercel using your GitHub account
2. Import the repository
3. Configure environment variables:
   - Basic Supabase, OpenAI/Anthropic, and application settings
   - See SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.txt for complete list
4. Click Deploy
5. Your app will be available at a Vercel-provided URL

### Option 2: Deploy Locally (Windows PC)

1. Install Node.js (v18+) and Git from their official websites
   - For Node.js: Choose the "Windows Installer" and check "Add to PATH" during installation
   - For Git: Select "Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt" during installation

2. Open Command Prompt as Administrator
   - Search for "Command Prompt" in Start menu
   - Right-click and select "Run as administrator"

3. Run these commands:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/rtpa-project-prioritization.git
   cd rtpa-project-prioritization
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a .env.local file with required environment variables
5. Run the app:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
6. Access at http://localhost:3000

### Option 3: Deploy to Your Own Server

1. Set up a Windows server with Node.js installed
2. Clone the repository and install dependencies
3. Configure environment variables
4. Build the production version:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
5. Start the server:
   ```
   npm run start
   ```
6. Consider using a process manager like PM2:
   ```
   npm install -g pm2
   pm2 start npm --name "rtpa-app" -- start
   ```

## Cost Estimates

- **Supabase**: Free tier for testing, $25+/month for production
- **OpenAI/Anthropic**: $10-50/month depending on usage
- **Vercel**: Free tier for testing, $20+/month for production
- **Mapbox**: Free tier available, pay-as-you-go for higher usage

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. Create an admin account
2. Configure organization settings
3. Set up scoring criteria
4. Create user accounts for team members
5. Start adding projects

## Portable App Version

A portable/offline version of the application is available for environments without continuous internet access. This version is maintained in the `portable-app` branch of the repository. For more information about this version and how it's maintained, refer to the BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md document.

For technical assistance, please contact your IT department or consider hiring a developer for a few hours to help with setup.

## Development Environment

For local development, use one of the following methods to start the development server:

### Windows Command Prompt
```
.\start-dev.bat
```

### PowerShell
```
.\start-dev.ps1
```
Or if you encounter execution policy restrictions:
```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\start-dev.ps1
```

These scripts ensure the server starts from the correct directory, avoiding common "package.json not found" errors.
