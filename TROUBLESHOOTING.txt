## Getting Additional Help

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. Take screenshots of any error messages
2. Note the exact steps that led to the problem
3. Contact technical support with this information
4. For urgent issues, consider hiring a developer familiar with Next.js and Supabase

## Git Workflow Issues

### Merge conflicts when syncing branches
- **Problem**: Conflicts arise when merging between branches
- **Solution**:
  1. Follow the branching strategy outlined in BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md
  2. Regularly pull changes from parent branches to minimize conflicts
  3. For complex conflicts, consider using a visual merge tool like VS Code or GitKraken

### Portable app branch out of sync
- **Problem**: The portable-app branch has diverged significantly from develop
- **Solution**:
  1. Follow the specific sync instructions in BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md
  2. Consider involving an experienced developer for complex merges
  3. Test thoroughly after merging to ensure portable-specific features still work

## Preventative Measures

To avoid common issues:

1. Regularly back up your Supabase database
2. Monitor your OpenAI usage to avoid unexpected charges
3. Keep your Node.js version updated
4. Test major changes in a development environment before applying to production
5. Document any custom configurations or modifications made to the system

## Environment Variables Issues

### "Error: Invalid environment variables" on startup
- **Problem**: The application can't find required environment variables or they're formatted incorrectly
- **Solution**:
  1. Check that you have a `.env` file in the project root (or `.env.local` for local development)
  2. Verify all required variables are set with proper values
  3. Make sure there are no spaces before or after the values
  4. Restart the application after making changes

### Missing or invalid environment variables
- **Problem**: Specific environment variables are missing or have invalid values
- **Solution**: 
  1. Check the following critical variables and ensure they have valid values:
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Should be a complete URL (e.g., https://abcdefghijklm.supabase.co)
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Should be a long string starting with "eyJhbGciOi..."
     - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Should be a long string starting with "eyJhbGciOi..."
     - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Should be a string starting with "sk-..."
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Should be a string starting with "pk.eyJ1..."
     - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: Should be a random string with no spaces
  2. For a complete reference of all environment variables, refer to the "Environment Variables Reference Guide" section in SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.txt

### "Environment variable not available on the client" errors
- **Problem**: Trying to use server-side variables on the client
- **Solution**:
  1. Only variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are available in the browser
  2. Make sure you're using the correct prefix for variables that need to be accessed in frontend code
  3. For security, keep sensitive keys like `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` as server-only variables (without the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix)

### Environment variables not showing up in Vercel deployment
- **Problem**: Environment variables not being applied to your Vercel deployment
- **Solution**:
  1. Go to your Vercel project → Settings → Environment Variables
  2. Check that all variables are added correctly
  3. Make sure you've set the variables in the correct environment (Production, Preview, Development)
  4. Redeploy your application after updating variables

### Local development vs. production environment variables
- **Problem**: Different environment needs for local vs. production
- **Solution**:
  1. For local development, use `.env.local` file
  2. For production, set environment variables in your hosting platform (e.g., Vercel)
  3. Consider using different values for:
     - `NODE_ENV`: "development" for local, "production" for deployment
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`: "http://localhost:3000" for local, your actual domain for production
     - `NEXTAUTH_URL`: Same as `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`
